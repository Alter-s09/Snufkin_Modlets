# Snufkin_Modlets
Unless stated otherwise, all of my mods are server-side.

# Snufkin_AdminBlocksAndFixes
Adds a unbreakable and paintable block helper, a intestructible landmine, a few indestructible doors, powered doors and lights. Adds all the rotations to the garage doors and adds an item that gives 10000 xP. Also fixes the vehicle and apparel stacknumber to 1 fo fix problems with other mods, specially the ones the add new dyes.


# Snufkin_Autominer
A new workstation that mines slowly the selected mineral. Uses gas a material and augers as tool. Needs at least 1 auger to work, with a max of 3. The quality and amount of augers used decreases the mining time to a max of 30 min per stack of 1000. Generates a bit more heat than a forge, so be carful.

# Snufkin_BiggerBackpackDrop
Replaces the dropped backpack model with the weapons bag one.

# Snufkin_BountyHunter
Currently only in spanish, but the basis is the following. You can craft a "Wanted Poster" from the crafting menu. Having JUST one on you when you kill another player gives you a bounty, displayed on the buffs area. Then, you can use the poster to craft your reward. Having more than 1 poster on you or moving the poster when you have the bounty makes you lose the reward. The bounty scales up with the target level, starting from lvl 5. Also, killing players with the "nearDeathTrauma" on them wont yield any reward.

# Snufkin_Chess
Just a craftable chess table and chess pieces, using Red, Blue and classic notation for the pieces. The set is crafted as a bundle that includes the table. Gathering all the pieces again lets you craft a bundle without the table.
